* macosrec

Take screenshots or videos (MP4 format) of macOS windows from the command line.

Videos are streamed directly to disk during recording for minimal memory usage and immediate file availability.

* Install
** Homebrew
#+begin_src sh
  brew tap xenodium/macosrec
  brew install macosrec
#+end_src
** Build
#+begin_src sh
  swift build
#+end_src
* Screenshot

Before taking a screenshot, identify the window number using =--list=.

#+begin_src sh
  $ macosrec --list

  21902 Emacs
  22024 Dock - Desktop Picture - Stone.png
  22035 Firefox - Planet Emacslife
#+end_src

Use =--screenshot= + window number to take a screenshot.

#+begin_src sh
  ~ $ macosrec --screenshot 21902
  ~/Desktop/2023-04-14-08:21:45-Emacs.png
#+end_src

* Videos

Before recording a video, identify the window number using =--list=.

#+begin_src sh
  $ macosrec --list

  21902 Emacs
  22024 Dock - Desktop Picture - Stone.png
  22035 Firefox - Planet Emacslife
#+end_src

Use =--record= + window number to start recording a video (MP4 format). The video file is created immediately and frames are streamed directly to disk.

/Note: you can also use application name and it will use the first window it finds belonging to it./

To end recording, send a SIGINT signal (Ctrl+C from terminal). Alternatively, running =macosrec --save= from another session would also end the recording.

#+begin_src sh
  ~ $ macosrec --record 21902
  Recording to: ~/Desktop/2023-04-14-08:21:45-Emacs.mp4
  ^C
  Saving...
  ~/Desktop/2023-04-14-08:21:45-Emacs.mp4
#+end_src

/Note: you can also use application name and it will use the first window it finds belonging to it./

#+begin_src sh
  ~ $ macosrec --record emacs
  Recording to: ~/Desktop/2023-04-14-08:21:45-Emacs.mp4
  ^C
  Saving...
  ~/Desktop/2023-04-14-08:21:45-Emacs.mp4
#+end_src

You can also specify a custom output path:

#+begin_src sh
  ~ $ macosrec --record emacs --output ~/Videos/my-recording.mp4
  Recording to: ~/Videos/my-recording.mp4
  ^C
  Saving...
  ~/Videos/my-recording.mp4
#+end_src

* Disclaimer

I built this util to record demos I post at [[https://xenodium.com][xenodium.com]]. Does the job so far, but can likely take improvements, specially around image handling efficiency. PRs totally welcome.

** Resizing windows while recording (not supported)

While a video will be recorded if you resize the window during the recording session, it's unlikely to produce a file with the expected outcome. This feature is currently unsupported and out of scope. Having said that, if anyone's keen to implement it, a PR is totally welcome.
